# Automated-Lithology-Classification-System-for-Drill-Core-Samples-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building an end-to-end Machine Learning system that automatically classifies drill core rock samples into lithology types. It includes image-based models, tabular ML models, a full website interface, flowcharts, and complete deployment-ready files.
